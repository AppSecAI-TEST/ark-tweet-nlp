CMU ARK Twitter Part-of-Speech Tagger
http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/

Requires Java 6.  To run the tagger:

    ./runTagger.sh -input example_tweets.txt -output tagged_tweets.txt

To build from source:
  scripts/compile.sh

To train and evalute the tagger, see:
  src/edu/cmu/cs/lti/ark/ssl/pos/SemiSupervisedPOSTagger.java

Directories
-----------
 * runTagger.sh  is the script you probably want
 * lib/          has runtime dependencies and trained model
 * lib_build/    has buildtime dependency
 * lib_twitter/  has Twitter's text commons annotations API
 * scripts/      helps you build and run
 * src/          has the actual source code (mostly java, and one bit of scala)

The lib_twitter stuff is optional; if you want to use it, you may wish to
update to a newer version of the library.  A demo can be invoked as:
  scripts/classwrap.sh -Xmx1g edu.cmu.cs.lti.ark.tweetnlp.twitter_anno.CMUPOSTagger
