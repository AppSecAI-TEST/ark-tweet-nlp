Directories
-----------
 * runTagger.sh  is the script you probably want
 * lib/          has runtime dependencies
 * lib_build/    has buildtime dependency
 * lib_twitter/  has the twitter-text and annotations API
 * scripts/      helps you build and run
 * src/          has the actual source code (mostly java, and one bit of scala)

The lib_twitter stuff is optional; if you want to use it, you may wish to
update to a newer version of the library.
