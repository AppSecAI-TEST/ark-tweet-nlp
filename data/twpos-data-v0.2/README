  Description:

    This is release v0.2 of a data set of tweets manually annotated with part-of-speech 
    tags. The annotated data is divided into three files: 
      "train" (1000 tweets),
      "dev" (327 tweets), and
      "test" (500 tweets). 
    Each file contains one token (with its tag separated by a tab) per line, and a blank 
    line to indicate a tweet boundary. See Gimpel et al. (2011) for information on the tagset.

    We attempted to anonymize all Twitter usernames within tweets. For this, we used a 
    hash from Twitter usernames to unique identifiers.

    The difference between this version and version 0.1 is the use of an improved Twitter tokenizer. 
    After the new tokenizer was run, tweets with differing tokenizations were reannotated following 
    the same guidelines as the initial release.
