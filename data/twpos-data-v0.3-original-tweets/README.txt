Retrieving the original tweets for the ARK Twitter POS annotated data 
(which are used in Tweebank too, I believe)

Data:

There is one json.tsv file for each of the two "supertsv" files 
(daily547 and oct27) from twpos-data-v0.3.

In the .json.tsv files, each line has three fields:

tweetid \t datestamp \t full tweet in JSON format
