Version 0.3

* 40 times faster: completely new implementation

* More accurate: improvements to many features, including much better unsupervised word clusters

* Trained on more data: new annotated data released as well, with linguistic fixes too


Version 0.2

* The tokenizer has been improved and integrated with the tagger in a single Java program. 

* The new tokenizer was run on the 1,827 tweets used for the annotation effort and the 
annotations were adapted for tweets with differing tokenizations. The revised annotations 
are contained in a companion v0.2 release of the data (twpos-data-v0.2).

* The tagging model is trained on ALL of the available annotated data in twpos-data-v0.2. 
The model in v0.1 was only trained on the training set.

* The tokenizer/tagger is integrated with Twitter's text commons annotations API.

Version 0.1
